# üõ†Ô∏è Customizing Third-Party Django Packages

Sometimes, a **third-party Django package** does almost what you want, but you need to tweak or extend it. Instead of rewriting everything, you can treat the package as a Django **app** inside your project and customize it.


## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Customize

1. **Download the source code** of the package (from GitHub, PyPI, or by unzipping site-packages).
2. Place it in your **project directory** as an app.
3. Add it to **`INSTALLED_APPS`** like a normal app.
4. Explore and adjust the code:

   * Fix bugs
   * Change behavior
   * Add new features


## ‚úÖ Example

Suppose you want to customize the behavior of `django-taggit`:

1. Download `django-taggit` source.
2. Copy the `taggit/` folder into your Django project.
3. Add `"taggit"` to your `INSTALLED_APPS`.
4. Open the source and modify how `TaggableManager` works.

Now your project uses **your modified version** instead of the installed package.


üìå **Tip**:

* Keep a note of customizations (for future upgrades).
* Prefer **subclassing** or **signals** when possible, to avoid maintaining a fork.
